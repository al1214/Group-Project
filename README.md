# Group-Project

1. Create a Python Jupyter notebook and name it Group Project Part b.

2. In the notebook, list the names of the group members on the top. 

3.  Pre-process and clean the dataset. You may reuse code (along with any changes suggested in feedback) from task a. There are no points for this step.

4. Using the steps learned in class, build a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model (1.5 point)

5. As done in class, build a data-frame that shows the keywords associated with each document (e.g., review) and the dominant topic along with its percentage contribution to each document. (1.5 points)

6. Upload your completed and well commented Jupyter notebook on Canvas by due date.
